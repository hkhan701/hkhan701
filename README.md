## ![meowdy](/assets/meowdy1x.webp "meowdy") About Me

I am a highly skilled and motivated software engineer with a passion for developing innovative solutions.  I am also passionate about building beautiful, intuitive, and performant web applications. 

With a strong foundation in computer science from the University of Manitoba, I am dedicated to continuous learning and driving technological advancements. I am in my 3rd year of University and part of the co-op program, currently studying distributed systems, AI, and statistics. As a team member, I pay attention to the details, maintain a healthy team workflow, give space to my teammates to grow, and enjoy working with people who know more than me.

I am currently working on a few personal projects and always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. I also run a 3D printing service, dabble in 3D modeling,  and love to tinker with robotics!
